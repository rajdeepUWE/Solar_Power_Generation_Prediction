# Solar_Power_Generation_Prediction


Time Series Forecasting with Prophet and ARIMA
In this project, we explore time series forecasting using two popular methods: Prophet and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). We use a solar power generation dataset to predict future DC power generation.

Data Description
The dataset contains records of DC power generation with various attributes, including date-time information. We aim to forecast DC power generation based on historical data.

Prophet Forecasting
Prophet is a forecasting tool developed by Facebook that is particularly effective for time series data with strong seasonal patterns. Here's what we did with Prophet:

Data Preprocessing:

We parsed the date-time column to create a time series dataset.
We divided the data into a training set and a testing set.
Model Training:

We trained a Prophet model on the training data, specifying 'ds' (date) and 'y' (DC power) columns.
Forecast Generation:

We used the trained Prophet model to generate forecasts for the testing period.
Visualization:

We visualized the Prophet forecast alongside the actual values from the testing dataset.
Evaluation:

We assessed the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Prophet Results:

R2 Score: 0.897975
MAE: 20164.08
RMSE: 27030.25
ARIMA Forecasting
ARIMA is a classical time series forecasting method that is widely used for various types of time series data. Here's an overview of the ARIMA approach:

Data Preparation:

We divided the data into a training set and a testing set.
Model Selection:

We used the auto_arima function from the pmdarima library to automatically select the best ARIMA model for our data.
Forecast Generation:

We generated ARIMA forecasts for the testing period.
Visualization:

We visualized the ARIMA forecast along with the actual values from the testing dataset.
Evaluation:

We assessed the model's performance using metrics such as R2, MAE, and RMSE.
ARIMA Results:

R2 Score: 0.894025
MAE: 15882.18
RMSE: 25400.80
Conclusion
Both Prophet and ARIMA are effective methods for time series forecasting. In this project, Prophet achieved slightly better results in terms of R2 score but had higher MAE and RMSE compared to ARIMA. The choice between the two methods depends on specific project requirements, computational resources, and interpretability. We recommend evaluating both methods to determine the most suitable forecasting approach for your application.
